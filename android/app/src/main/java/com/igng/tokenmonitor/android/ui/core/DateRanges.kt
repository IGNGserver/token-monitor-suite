/**
 * Calendar windows for the scope presets that are *not* periods on the wire.
 *
 * Day / month / total ship with every stats snapshot because the collector scans
 * exactly those three windows.  "Yesterday" and "this week" are calendar ranges in the
 * same sense as a hand-picked custom range, so they resolve through
 * `GET /api/usage/range` — the same rule the shared web UI uses
 * (`src/shared-ui/core/dateRanges.js`), which is what keeps the two clients reporting
 * the same number for the same tab.  A port that invents its own week boundary would
 * be a second measurement, not a second rendering of one.
 *
 * Bounds are whole local days and inclusive, matching the endpoint's
 * `startDate` / `endDate` / `startHour` / `endHour` vocabulary: the final day is asked
 * for with `endHour = 23`, which is how the desktop host reads "include that whole
 * hour".  `docs/API.md` notes the totals are day-rounded on the Hub side either way.

   * the same Monday (`Intl.Locale#weekInfo` is absent in the Chromium builds both hosts
   * run on, and the port pins it deliberately now), so one "本周" label cannot answer two
   * different totals depending on which client asked.  A CLDR-following port was exactly
   * the second measurement the note above warns about — under a US locale its window
   * started a day earlier and the same tab showed a bigger number than the browser.

   * picker's calendar are presentation, and neither one produces a reported figure.
