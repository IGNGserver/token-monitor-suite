/**
 * The one rule that turns a scope selection into a number.
 *
 * Both surfaces used to own a copy: the analytics screen gated the cached range answer
 * on [AnalyticsPeriodKind.needsRange] while the overview screen preferred
 * `customRangeResult` for *every* tab.  A cached range therefore kept rendering under
 * 今日/本月/全部, which showed up as "the overview and the analytics page disagree" plus
 * two groups of tabs printing the identical figure.  One shared resolver makes that
 * class of bug structurally impossible, and it is a plain function so the JVM suite can
 * assert it (the module's Compose runtime is not loadable there — see `DisplayFx.kt`).
 *
 * The invariant: **a range answer belongs only to the selection that asked for it.**
 * A snapshot period is never replaced by a cached range, and a preset tab never accepts
 * a result fetched for a different window — including the same preset from yesterday.
